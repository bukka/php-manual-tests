If the assassination // Could trammel up the consequence, and catch, // With his surcease, success; that but this blow // Might be the be-all and the end-all--here, // But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,-- // We'd jump the life to come. But in these cases // We still have judgement here; that we but teach // Bloody instructions, which being taught, return // To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice // Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice // To our own lips. He's here in double trust: // First, as I am his kinsman and his subject, // Strong both against the deed: then, as his host, // Who should against his murderer shut the door, // Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan // Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been // So clear in his great office, that his virtues // Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against // The deep damnation of his taking-off: // And pity, like a naked new-born babe, // Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin, hors'd // Upon the sightless couriers of the air, // Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye, // That tears shall drown the wind.--I have no spur // To prick the sides of my intent, but only // Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself, // And falls on the other. // Is this a dagger which I see before me, // The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee:-- // I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. // Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible // To feeling as to sight? or art thou but // A dagger of the mind, a false creation, // Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain? // I see thee yet, in form as palpable // As this which now I draw. // Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going; // And such an instrument I was to use. // Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses, // Or else worth all the rest: I see thee still; // And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, // Which was not so before.--There's no such thing: // It is the bloody business which informs // Thus to mine eyes.--Now o'er the one half-world // Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse // The curtain'd sleep; now witchcraft celebrates // Pale Hecate's offerings; and wither'd murder, // Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf, // Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace, // With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design // Moves like a ghost.--Thou sure and firm-set earth, // Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear // Thy very stones prate of my whereabout, // And take the present horror from the time, // Which now suits with it.--Whiles I threat, he lives; // Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives. // ", 1000));
